# Brain_tumor_Classification
# Brain Tumor Classification Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a brain tumor classification project. The project aims to classify brain tumor images into two categories: "no tumor" and "have tumor" using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of 26,000 brain tumor images. The dataset is divided into train, validation, and test sets. It can be downloaded from [insert dataset source or link].

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset or instructions on how to obtain the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: This directory contains the trained models saved in HDF5 format.
- `results/`: This directory contains the evaluation results, such as accuracy, loss, and metrics.
- `images/`: This directory contains sample images for testing or visualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor.git
2. Install the requirements 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the dataset or follow the instructions in the data/ directory to obtain the dataset.
4. Preprocess the data if necessary, using the Jupyter notebooks provided in the notebooks/ directory.
5. Train the models using the preprocessed data. The trained models will be saved in the models/ directory.
6. Evaluate the trained models using the test set and generate evaluation results.
7. Use the trained models for making predictions on new brain tumor images.

**Results**
The evaluation results for the trained models are as follows:

Model 1: Accuracy: 0.99, Loss: 0.01
Model 2: Accuracy: 0.92, Loss: 0.28
